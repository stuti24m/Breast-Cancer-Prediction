# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Building a Simple Machine Learning Model on Breast Cancer Data    || Still working on the deployment phase.
	This project is a part of EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) where the main characteristics are analysed followed by a visualization.
  
  Tasks performed in this model :
  1. Import essential libraries
  2. Load breast cancer dataset and explore
      -  Creating Dataframes
  3. Data Visualization
      - Pairplot
      - Counterplot
  4. Heatmap
      - heatmap of breast cancer data frame
      - heatmap of correlation matrix
  5. Correlation bar plot
  6. Data Processing
      - Split data frame in train and test
      - Feature Scaling
  7. Breast Cancer Deetction ML model
      - Support Vector Classifier
      - Logistic Regression
      - K-nearest neighbor Classifier
      - Naive Bayes Classifier
      - Decision tree Classifier
      - Random Forest Classifier
      - Adaboost Classifier
      - XGboost Classifier
          - XGboost Parameter tuning Randomized search
  8. Confusion matrix
  9. Classification report of model
  10. Cross Validation of model
  11. Saving the model
